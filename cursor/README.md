# Cursor

So far all this file has in it is cursorrules.txt, which can either be simlinked
into .cursorrules at the root of the project, or pased into the "User Rules"
section of cursor.

Inspired by the excellent gist from Francis Zeit: https://gist.github.com/fjzeit/c7b5d0ddf9a75ef890f467fd70c39e2f
